note 27th December 2025
Hi everyone and welcome to Odin Recipes.

My name is Sam, I am creating this as part of the Odin project for full stack development.  

I have a partially technical background with a lot of experience reading code, but not so much writing it (other than SQL), hopefully that will change!

The Odin project is a full stack web development course and I'm hoping to be able to create web applications in the future.
